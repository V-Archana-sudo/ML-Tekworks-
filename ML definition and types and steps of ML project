Machine Learning Project Lifecycle:

1.problem Definition: Identify what problem you are trying to solve.
2.data Collection: Collection of data from kaggle,API(Application Programming interface:carry data from one place to another place is known as API).
3.data Preprocessing: Converting data types Or cleaning data.
4.EDA(Exploratory Data analysis) : After removing we will see patterns.
5.feature engineering: we will select the features.
6.model selection: we will select model.
7.model evaluation(to evaluate we have r square).
8.hyperparameter tuning: we will improve the model accuracy.
9.model deployment.
10.monitoring and maintenance.
